# sdlc-devtools
Development Tools to make the Software Development Lifecycle easier (Git, Node, Bash, Java, JS, etc.)

TODO 

# Create a setup or configuration script which will auto-link the tools based on user input. Not everyone will want to use Git's minimal msys. And now that Bash for Windows is getting better, switching to that might be better. The commands can stay the same, except they'll be launched via bash.exe -c [CMD]. Then paths can be converted using the cygpath program.

# Categorize the commands based on need.

# Support automatically downloading and updating the tools. 

# Support Profiles. Perhaps one project requires a certain version of Java and a certain version of Maven. It would be nice to have all the same commands available but with different versions and setups based on the User's need.
